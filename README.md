SYNOPSIS
--------
> What do I even put here?

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This repository is used to try out [Git](http://git-scm.com).

WORKFLOW
--------
* Do not consider this repository.
* You might fork, pull request and all workcandy.
 * But just as how you don't normally consider _this_;
 * We won't consider _yours_.

DISCUSSION

> Head to the [Issues](https://github.com/whisperity/try_git/issues) page.

Lowering the semi-professional tone:
This is a **test** repository. Good luck out there, buddy!

> And have fun with Git!

### Branch information

This is a branch for trying out pull requests.

Some changes were made:
* The whole repository is cleaned up.
* Example submodule deleted.

Until this point, it could be an easy _fast-forward_ merge. **But!**
Because of this `README.md` having been edited in both sides of the
merge, it should result in a conflict. We shall see...
